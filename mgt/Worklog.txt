   - I need to do a Python tutorial /course
   - I need to do a pyplot tutorial/course ( for the Plotter )
   - I need to make a sort of test cases for the RBD
   - Add info and configuration about the  about noise level parameters  

19/06
   - created mgt folder
   - read about the structure of a python program, still learning a lot on this, to read more
   - implemented Rtm2euler angles 
   - started to look at test cases, I need a better logger
     mainly to write to files the test file output
   - went through roughly half of PEP8, at some point to continue
   - updated the mgt sheet, plenty of tasks for tomorrow :)

20/06
   - worked on the looger
   - added the quaternions ( maybe need more documentation here, and look at numerically stable integration  see if I can do better, but low prio for now)
   - worked on testcases 
   - worked a bit on style, changed more variables to lower case 
   - started to look on timeit 
   - short day, not a bad day

   - rigid body with rotm is fastes, but qith quaternions is more precise, by looking at Test Cases 110 & 111, oy

   - implemented the ftau model, using a paper. Cannot understand the rotors transfer functions though, how to use it. Is not stable. how to combine with the steady state relation also. so this part is out

   -  I am testing a rolling command on the combined dynamic and kinematic model (ftau_plus_rb).
   Rolling is coupled with yawing and pitching. This is because ( nice to test, can be exercise to show on paper)
                a) yawing - because the cmd2thrust2torque is not linear. 
				Adding +10 and -10 commands respectively to the rolling pair-of engines, 
				causes the difference in torque. Yawing is not exactly conpensated by +-10 strategy. But it is very close.
			    b) yawing + pitching  - due to the rigid body eq for angular acceleration, via a non-diagonal inertia matrix, 
				there is coupling between rolling and pitching and rolling and yawing
				c) Even if the inertia matrix is diagonal, via the same rigid body eq for angular acceleration, there is coupling between rolling/yawing and pitching.
                This can be further reduced by increasing Iyy element  				
    However, the trens should be clear:
          - I should have rolling angular velocity bigger than the othwer two, making euler roll also bigger  
          - Positive rolling should cause negative y-axis movement
		  
    Quaternions are more numerically stable than rotm ( sam exp, same norm treshold for warning, rotm warning appears, quaternions warning not)
   
    Spyder 4.0.0b2 has code folding. Have installed it
	
OKEII! Model finished. Tested and all. Looking good for a first iteration.

Three possible directions of immediate interest:
   a) Documentation - maybe in the form of slides, good for courses also  : USE LATEX + BEAMER 
   b) code cleanup / API interface , and that setup tingy - how to make the package , block diagrm drawing ...
   c) start buidling sensors interface , PID flight stabilization, so we can use it to something 
   
Started on a) and made a course on Udemy   
           b) installed MikTex with Texworks,  imported the AAU beamer theme. Made first slides for the course introduction. Installed Inkscape.
           c) installes OBS ( Open Broadcast Software ) for screen capturing and OpenShot for editing. And VLC media player.
